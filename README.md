# sans-fight-unity
This is a fanmade remake of the popular fight in Undertale featuring Sans the Skeleton.

I do not claim ownership of any art and audio asset used in the project. The audio and art assets are from Toby Fox and Temmie Cheng respectively. Everything else from the level design, animations, and programming were done completely from scratch.

Undertale (2015) is developed by Toby Fox. This project was made for entertainment and educational purposes only and is in no way affiliated with the main developer of this video game.
