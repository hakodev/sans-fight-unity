First attempt and only until the opening attack is survived once:

it's a beautiful day outside.
birds are singing, flowers are blooming...
on days like these, kids like you...
	Should be burning in hell. [Sans's voice is not present for this line.]
		huh. always wondered why people never use their strongest attack first. [First time the player survives the opening attack]


After surviving the opening attack once:

it's a beautiful day outside.
birds are singing, [abruptly cuts to the opening attack]
	anyway, as i was saying, it's a nice day out. why not relax and take a load off? [Second time surviving the opening attack]


After surviving the opening attack 2 or more times:

ready?
	here we go. [After the attack]


Player attacks:

1: what? you think i'm just gonna stand there and take it?
2: our reports showed a massive anomaly in the timespace continuum.
   timelines jumping left and right, stopping and starting...
3: until suddenly, everything ends.
4: heh heh heh... that's your fault, isn't it?
5: you can't understand how this feels.
6: knowing that one day, without any warning...
   it's all going to be reset.
7: look. i gave up trying to go back a long time ago.
8: and getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore, either.
9: cause even if we do...
   we'll just end up right back here, without any memory of it, right?
10: to be blunt...
    it makes it kind of hard to give it my all.
11: ... or is that just a poor excuse for being lazy...?
    hell if i know.
12: all i know is... seeing what comes next...
    i can't afford not to care anymore.
13: [music fades]

ugh... that being said...
you, uh, really like swinging that thing around, huh?
...
listen.

[Normal spare dialogue]
i know you didn't answer me before, but...
somewhere in there. i can feel it.
there's a glimmer of a good person inside of you.
the memory of someone who once wanted to do the right thing.
someone who, in another time, might have even been...
a friend?
c'mon, buddy.
do you remember me?
please, if you're listening...
let's forget all this, ok?
just lay down your weapon, and...
well, my job will be a lot easier.

[Spare dialogue if the player has previously tried sparing Sans]
friendship...
it's really great, right?
let's quit fighting.

Spare:
...
you're sparing me?
finally.
buddy. pal.
i know how hard it must be...
to make that choice.
to go back on everything you've worked up to.
i want you to know... i won't let it go to waste.
...
c'mere, pal.
[Sans kills player, game over screen after sparing Sans]
geeettttttt dunked on!!!
if we're really friends...
you won't come back.

Attack:
14: welp, it was worth a shot.
    guess you like doing things the hard way, huh? (proceed to 15)

    [If the player previously tried sparing Sans]
    woah, you look REALLY pissed off...
    heheheh...
    did i getcha?
    well, if you came back anyway...
    i guess that means we never really WERE friends, huh?
    heh.
    don't tell that to the other sans-es, ok?
15: sounds strange, but before all this i was secretly hoping we could be friends.
    i always thought the anomaly was doing this cause they were unhappy.
    and when they got what they wanted, they would stop all this.
16: and maybe all they needed was... i dunno.
    some good food, some bad laughs, some nice friends.
17: but that's ridiculous, right?
    yeah, you're the type of person who won't EVER be happy.
18: you'll keep consuming timelines over and over, until...
    well.
    hey.
    take it from me, kid.
    someday...
    you gotta learn when to QUIT.
19: and that day's TODAY.
20: cause... y'see...
    all this fighting is really tiring me out.
21: and if you keep pushing me...
    then i'll be forced to use my special attack. ("special attack" in red text)
22: yeah, my special attack. sound familiar? ("special attack" in red text)
    well, get ready. cause after the next move, i'm going to use it. ("use it" in red text)
    so, if you don't want to see it, now would be a good time to die.
23: well, here goes nothing...
    are you ready?
    survive THIS and i'll show you my special attack! ("special attack" in red text)

After 23:
huff... puff...
all right. that's it.
it's time for my special attack. ("special attack" in red text)
are you ready?
here goes nothing.

yep.
that's right.
it's literally nothing.
and it's not going to be anything, either.
heh heh heh... ya get it?
i know i can't beat you.
one of your turns...
you're just gonna kill me.
so, uh.
i've decided...
it's not gonna BE your turn. ever.
i'm just gonna keep having MY turn until you give up.
even if it means we have to stand here until the end of time.
capiche?

you'll get bored here.
if you haven't gotten bored already, i mean.
and then, you'll finally quit.

i know your type.
you're, uh, very determined, aren't you?
you'll never give up, even if there's, uh...
absolutely NO benefit to persevering whatsoever.
if i can make that clear.
no matter what, you'll just keep going.
not out of any desire for good or evil...
but just because you think you can.
and because you "can"...
... you "have to."

but now, you've reached the end.
there is nothing left for you now.
so, uh, in my personal opinion...
the most "determined" thing you can do here?
is to, uh, completely give up.
and... (yawn) do literally anything else.

24: heh, didja really think you would be able
25 (automatic):
...
...
...
so...
guess that's it, huh?
...
just...
don't say i didn't warn you.
welp.
i'm going to grillby's.
papyrus, do you want anything?
