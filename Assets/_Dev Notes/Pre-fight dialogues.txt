First attempt:

heya.
you've been busy, huh?
...
so, i've got a question for ya.
do you think even the worst person can change...?
that everyone can be a good person, if they just try?
heh heh heh heh...
all right.
well, here's a better question.
do you wanna have a bad time?
cause if you take another step forward...
you are REALLY not going to like what happens next.
welp.
sorry, old lady.
this is why i never make promises.


1 death:

heya.
you look frustrated about something.
guess i'm pretty good at my job, huh?


2 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died twice in a row.
suffice to say, you look really... unsatisfied.
all right.
how 'bout we make it a third?


3 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died thrice in a row.

5 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died five times in a row.
convenient, huh? that's one for each finger.
but soon...
you'll need a cool mutant hand to count all of your deaths.


6 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died six times in a row.
that's the number of fingers on a mutant hand.
but soon...
you'll need to find a mutant hand with even more fingers.


7 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died seven times in a row.
hey, that's good. seven's supposed to be a lucky number.
who knows, maybe you'll hit the jackpot...
and that number will multiply tenfold.

that's the expression of someone who's died eight times in a row.
that's the number of fingers on a spider.
but soon...
wait, don’t spiders have legs?


9 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died seven times in a row.

or was it ten?


10 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died ten times in a row.
hey, congrats! the big one-oh!
let's invite all your friends over for a big shindig.
we can have pie, and hot dogs, and...
hmmm... wait. something's not right.
you don't have any friends.


11 deaths:

hmm. that expression...
that's the expression of someone who's died eleven times in a row.
well, give or take.
there's nuance to this stuff.
don't think i'll be able to count very well from here.
count for me, ok?
we'll start from 12.


12 deaths and beyond:

let's just get to the point.
